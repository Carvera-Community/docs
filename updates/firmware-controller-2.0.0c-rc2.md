# Firmware/Controller 2.0.0c-RC2

Today we release a new Release Candidate of the Carvera Community Firmware and Controller! These projects are not affiliated with Makera, and exist to go above and beyond what is provided by the OEM software. Barring any major bugs discovered in the next week we will be releasing a stable version of v2.0.0c next weekend!

**New functionality highlights of 2.0.0c-RC2**

Full details to come in the 2.0.0c release. Here is a taste for those interested in testing the Release Candidate:

* 3D Probe Tip Calibration UI complete. See [Youtube instructional video](https://youtu.be/egbb5Q1fNXw?si=ALmQ8EzgcbV2YOWx) and [getting started article](https://carvera-community.gitbook.io/docs/firmware/features/3d-probe-support) for more details.
* Machine Calibration UI complete. Now you can use the 3D probe to precisely set the Anchor and 4th axis positions
* Probing UI Improvements: The probing UI now shows the MDI feedback after running
* New Controller config options:
  * Allow Jogging When Machine is Running - This allows advanced users to perform manual milling operations
  * Max FPS - The Controller’s resource consumption can be controlled by adjusting the max rendering FPS
  * Tooltips can be turned on and off, and delay can be configured.
  * Many bugs squashed, see detailed notes for details
