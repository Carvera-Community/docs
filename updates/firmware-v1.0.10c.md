# Firmware v1.0.10c

Today we release Carvera Community Firmware 1.0.10c! These projects are not affiliated with Makera, and exists to go above and beyond what is provided by the OEM software.

This is a quick bugfix release to resolve some of the issues with 1.0.9.\
It should fix the crashing on file start and wrong Z height when changing WCS.\
It also gives more verbose output when printing WCS coordinates to the MDI for debugging.
