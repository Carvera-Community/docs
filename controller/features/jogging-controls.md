The machine can be jogged via three possible inputs:

* Clicking on the UI buttons with the mouse or touchscreen.
* Using the keyboard arrow buttons, and Pg Up/Down
* [Pendant](pendant-support.md)



## Advanced Jogging Options

The Control screen has a number of additional Jogging related options:

* Speed: Default to Max
* Mode: Step or Continuous

* Pendant Jogging: If a [Pendant ](pendant-support.md)is configured whether moving it's jog wheel will move the machine or not

## Keyboard Jogging

If Keyboard Jogging is toggled on (blue button background) the following keys can be used to move the spindle:

* Arrow keys move X/Y
* Pg Up - Increase the Z
* Pg Down - Decrease the Z

## Continuous Jogging

When the machine is running a supported firmware (>2.0.0c) continuous jogging capability is possible. In this mode the machine will move at a constant speed (as specified by the Jog Speed option) in the direction of the button press while the button is held down. This applies to both the UI buttons and the Keyboard Input
