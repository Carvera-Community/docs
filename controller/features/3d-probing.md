# 3D Probing

##

{% hint style="warning" %}
A 3D probe is required to use most of the options. The probe included with the machine can only probe in the Z axis.
{% endhint %}

## 3D Probing Screens

A number of [Probing routines](../../firmware/supported-commands/mcodes/probing.md) have been added to the firmware, the Controller has graphical representations for many of them found by pressing the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt="Probing" data-size="line"> button in the center control panel.

## Setting 3D Probe Tool

The option to set the current tool to 3D Probe is available under the set menu. Remember that this doesn't automatically Calibrate the Tool Length Offset, so  you should run the Calibrate routine from the dropdown after setting the probe.
