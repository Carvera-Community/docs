# HSM Tool Library

All the Makera cutters from the [Makera Shop](https://global.makera.com/collections/cnc-bits) have been defined in HSMLib format and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Carvera-Community/Carvera_Community_Profiles/releases/tag/toollibraries).

HSMLib tool libraries are importable into HSM Advisor, Fusion360, Solidworks, and many other CAM programs
